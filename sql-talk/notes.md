## Rabbit Hole
- So you might be wondering how a construction PM goes down this rabbit hole  **NEXT SLIDE**  

## Construction
- Still very archaic with technology for the most part
- architect's, engineers and some general contractors starting to integrate  **NEXT SLIDE**  
- subcontractors are a different breed, stick to what we know, refuse change  **NEXT SLIDE**  
- what does that mean? we love paper! **NEXT SLIDE**
- i mean, really love paper
- this is about 6 months of projects, half of what we used to use
- one stack measured to be about 1-1/2" thick
- if you are a data guy, this is probably your nightmare, because all of this will rot in a box for 7 years  
- and i'm sure this happens all the time  
- my wife is home builder, i've seen invoices, i know we arent the only ones  **NEXT SLIDE**
