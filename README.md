# Talks
This repository is a holding cell for the talks I have given to **Techlahoma** User Groups. I will do my best to provide links below for more efficient navigation and break out the talks into respective topics as the repository grows. 

## Directory
- **Integrating freeCodeCamp with GitHub**: This was the first lightning talk I gave to a **Techlahoma** User Group, about how I integrated a sandbox in a local IDE and learning how to work with GitHub at the same time. The [slides](http://slides.com/mstub/freecodecamp-github) are available as well as a [recording](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/181064911). There is no sample code or slides available in the repository, they were created with [Slides.com](https://www.slides.com).
- **[Sample Portfolio](bs4-portfolio)**: A talk given to OKC freeCodeCamp over a single page portfolio website constructed with Boopstrap4. This was my first full length talk. The recorded talk can be found [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/187979956)
